## Dev meets Gus

### The classic scenario

Dev and Gus meet at a coworking space. Dev has booked a conference room and Gus brings his slideshow up. There are some crude drawings of what he wants the software to look like and he has a list of features he wants.

Gus: "I'm looking for someone that can create this software for us, what do you think?"

Dev: "This is a great idea, I think we can help you with that. We can build this software for you. I will draw up an offer for this functionality and we can discuss the details."

Gus: "Great, I'm looking forward to it."

Dev
